    "* Cancer hallmark focus: Angiogenesis\n",
    "* Overview of hallmark: Angiogenesis is when new blood vessels form from existing ones. Tumors need oxygen and nutrients to grow beyond a very small size (about 1–2 mm). To achieve this, cancer cells release pro-angiogenic signals — most importantly VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) — which stimulate nearby normal blood vessels to sprout new branches that grow into the tumor. Angiogenesis genes vary across cancer types, and are associated with a number of genomic and immunological features. Further, it was noted that macrophages and iTreg infiltration were generally higher in tumours with high angiogenesis scores, whereas lymphocytes and B cells showed the opposite trend. Notably, NK cells showed significantly different correlations among cancer types\n",

    "*Will you be focusing on a single cancer type or looking across cancer types? Depending on your decision, update this section to include relevant information about the disease at the appropriate level of detail. Regardless, each bullet point should be filled in. If you are looking at multiple cancer types, you should investigate differences between the types (e.g. what is the most prevalent cancer type? What type has the highest mortality rate?) and similarities (e.g. what sorts of treatments exist across the board for cancer patients? what is common to all cancers in terms of biological mechanisms?). Note that this is a smaller list than the initial 11 in Module 1.*\n",
